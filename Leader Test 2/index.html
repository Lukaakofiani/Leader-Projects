          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
          for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
          The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
          the course, I’ve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”
